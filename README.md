### Limitations

1. Provided tests do not cover fully functionality, such as:
	- checking API layer (requests and responses for selecting specific country)
	- checking page content updated after selecting specific country
2. Tests are not set up for CI, in matter of time-consuming.
3. Project devices were taken from default Playwright config
4. Repo branching was not applied, due to time saving.

## Test Object

## Types of Testing

Automated testing of UI behaviour of the Country selector component

## Test Framework

Playwright + JS
